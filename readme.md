## Getting Started

### Enter Your OpenCage API Key

When the program loads, you will be prompted to enter an OpenCage API key (a 32-character string).

If you do not have an API key, visit [OpenCage Geocoder](https://opencagedata.com/api) to obtain one.

If a valid API key is provided, it will be stored for future use.

**Note:** If no API key is entered, geolocation features (address lookup) will not work.

**Note:** The addresses entered are sent to opencagedata and they return the geolocation of the addresses entered.

## Adding Markers to the Map

### Click on the Map to Add a Marker

Click anywhere on the interactive map to place a marker.

The program will attempt to retrieve the address for the selected location.
